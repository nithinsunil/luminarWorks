                <p>Corn -- the workhorse of the industrial world -- is best when its sweet variety is fried up with
                    lashings of butter till it bursts and then snarfed in greasy fistfuls while watching Netflix late at
                    night.</p>

                <p>A crispy, rice-batter crepe encases a spicy mix of mashed potato, which is then dipped in coconut
                    chutney, pickles, tomato-and-lentil-based sauces and other condiments. It's a fantastic breakfast
                    food that'll keep you going till lunch, when you'll probably come back for another.</p>

                <p>It's unclear when and where the potato chip was born. US legend has it that they were invented in New
                    York in 1853, but the earliest known recipe for "Potatoes Fried in Slices or Shavings" appears in a
                    bestselling 1817 cookbook by Englishman William Kitchiner.</p>

                <p>The sea is lapping just by your feet, a warm breeze whips the tablecloth around your legs and a
                    steamy pan of paella sits in front of you. Shrimp, lobster, mussels and cuttlefish combine with
                    white rice and various herbs, oil and salt in this Valencian dish to send you immediately into
                    holiday mode.</p>

                    tamarind juice, fish sauce, peanuts, dried shrimp, tomatoes, lime juice, sugar cane paste, string

                    oily rice, with sliced cucumber as the token vegetable. Variants include roasted chicken or soy

                <p>If Malcolm Gladwell says it's a perfect food, then it's a perfect food. Let's face it, anything that
                    can convince 2-year-olds to eat their carrots rather than spitting them onto the floor is worthy of
                    not just a "delicious" title, but a "miracle of persuasion" title, too.</p>

                <div><img src="./images/frenchtoast.jpg" alt="" class="w-100"></div>
                <p>Unlike its more restrained Sunday brunch counterpart, Hong Kong-style French toast is like a
                    deep-fried hug. Two pieces of toast are slathered with peanut butter or kaya jam, soaked in egg
                    batter, fried in butter and served with still more butter and lots of syrup. A Hong Kong best food,
                    best enjoyed before cholesterol checks.</p>

                <p>Melted Parmesan and mozzarella cheese, and a peppery, garlicky tomato sauce drizzled over the top of
                    a chicken fillet -- Aussie pub-goers claim this ostensibly Italian dish as their own. Since they
                    make it so well, there's no point in arguing.</p>

                <p>This humble Middle Eastern spread, made with chickpeas, garlic, lemon juice and tahini has become a
                    fridge staple all around the world. This tangy treat tastes good as a dip, with breads, with meats,
                    with vegetables, beans or -- hear us out -- on a Marmite rice cake.</p>

                <h3>Chilli Crab</h3>
                <div><img src="./images/chillicrab.jpg" alt="" class="w-100"></div>
                <p>You can't visit Singapore without trying its spicy, sloppy, meaty specialty. While there are dozens
                    of ways to prepare crab (with black pepper, salted egg yolk, cheese-baked, et cetera) chili crab
                    remains the local bestseller. Spicy chili-tomato gravy tends to splatter, which is why you need to
                    mop everything up with mini mantou buns.</p>
